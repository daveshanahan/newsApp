          'Summer holidays overseas are "extremely unlikely" because of the risk of travellers bringing coronavirus variants back to the UK, a scientist on a government advisory body has said. The UK faces a real risk if people travel abroad, Dr Mike Tildesley said. Foreign holidays are currently not allowed and returning travellers have to quarantine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was too early to tell when holidays abroad would be allowed. Under the current roadmap for easing restrictions, the earliest date people in England could holiday abroad would be 17 May. nPeople can currently travel abroad for a limited number of reasons, such as education or work, with anyone who does having to fill in a Declaration to Travel form stating a valid reason for leaving the country. A government taskforce will report to the prime minister on 12 April detailing when and how international travel can resume. In Scotland, national clinical director Jason Leitch also said foreign summer holidays in Europe were looking less likely as Covid numbers in some countries were a cause for concern. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Saturday morning half of all adults in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine. Friday was also a record-breaking day for jabs, Mr Hancock added.',
